Hi everyone, posting a quick update as part of my ESM 244 course. It's currently week 6 (out of 10 weeks, in the UC quarter system). I am currently taking GIS, Ecology, Biogeochemistry, Politics of the Environment, and Advanced Data Science. I'm currently prepping for my Biogeochemistry midterm... got to go study now!
